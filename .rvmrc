# According to https://github.com/javan/whenever: 
# If your production environment uses RVM (Ruby Version Manager) you will run into a gotcha that causes your cron jobs to 
# hang. This is not directly related to Whenever, and can be tricky to debug. Your .rvmrc files must be trusted or else 
# the cron jobs will hang waiting for the file to be trusted. A solution is to disable the prompt by adding this 
# line to your user rvm file in ~/.rvmrc:  
#
# rvm_trust_rvmrcs_flag=1
#

rvm_trust_rvmrcs_flag=1
rvm use 1.9.3-p327@policy_machine --create
